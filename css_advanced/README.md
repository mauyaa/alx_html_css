# Advanced CSS Styling Project

## Overview

This project focuses on enhancing the visual appearance of a web page using advanced CSS techniques, following a detailed design provided via Figma. It aims to transform a basic HTML structure into a polished, visually appealing layout by applying precise styling and layout rules.

## Objectives

- Implement advanced CSS styling that matches the Figma design specifications.
- Utilize custom fonts, including Source Sans Pro and Spin Cycle OT, to achieve the intended typography.
- Accurately apply layout, spacing, color, and typography as outlined in the design.
- Integrate images and logos where relevant to enhance visual fidelity.
- Ensure responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility where possible.
- Follow good semantic HTML practices, adjusting the given HTML markup as necessary.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx_html_css.git
   cd alx_html_css/css_advanced
Open index.html in your browser to view the styled page.

Use the accompanying CSS files and assets (images, fonts) to replicate the design.

Notes
Some numerical CSS values from Figma may be float values; these can be rounded for practicality.

Make sure to include the correct font imports or @font-face declarations in your CSS.

Adjust HTML where necessary to accommodate logos and other visual elements.

### For your **index.html**, you can:

- Start from the provided advanced HTML structure (from your course or prompt)
- Add `<link>` to the CSS stylesheet (`style.css`)
- Add `<link>` or `@font-face` for fonts
- Add `<img>` tags for logos and images downloaded from the provided assets

---

If you want, I can help you generate a **starter index.html** with placeholders for images and font links based on your HTML advanced concept page.  

Would you like me to do that?
